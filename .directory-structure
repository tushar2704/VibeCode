# Directory Structure Created

This file tracks the creation of our guide's directory structure.

## Created Directories:
- docs/ - Main documentation directory
- examples/ - Code examples and templates
- tutorials/ - Interactive tutorials and exercises

Directory structure will be expanded as we build each section.
