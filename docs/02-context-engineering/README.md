## üìã Product Requirements Prompts (PRP)

### The PRP Methodology

Product Requirements Prompts systematically gather all necessary context through intelligent questioning and discovery processes.

#### Phase 1: Discovery Questions
```markdown
## Application Type & Scope Discovery

### Primary Function
- What is the main problem this application solves?
- Who are the primary users and what are their goals?
- What does success look like for this project?

### Technical Scope
- Is this a new application or enhancement to existing system?
- What platforms need to be supported? (Web, mobile, desktop)
- Are there existing systems that need integration?

### Scale & Performance
- How many users do you expect initially and at scale?
- What are the critical performance requirements?
- Are there specific availability or reliability requirements?

### Business Constraints
- What is the timeline for delivery?
- What is the budget range for development and operations?
- Are there regulatory or compliance requirements?
```

#### Phase 2: Technical Requirements
```markdown
## Technical Architecture Discovery

### Technology Preferences
- Do you have preferred technologies or existing tech stack?
- Are there any technology constraints or requirements?
- What is the team's expertise and comfort level?

### Data & Security
- What types of data will the application handle?
- Are there specific security or privacy requirements?
- What are the data backup and recovery needs?

### Integration Requirements
- What external services need to be integrated?
- Are there existing APIs or databases to connect with?
- What authentication systems should be used?

### Deployment & Operations
- What is the preferred hosting environment?
- Who will be responsible for ongoing maintenance?
- What monitoring and alerting capabilities are needed?
```

#### Phase 3: Context Synthesis
```markdown
## Context Engineering Synthesis

Based on discovery responses, generate:

1. **System Context**: Role definition for AI assistant
2. **Domain Context**: Technology stack and patterns
3. **Task Context**: Specific requirements and constraints
4. **Smart Defaults**: Intelligent assumptions and configurations
5. **Decision Trees**: Guidance for common development decisions
```

## üå≥ Smart Defaults & Decision Trees

### Smart Defaults Framework

Instead of asking users to make every technical decision, Context Engineering provides intelligent defaults based on common patterns and best practices.

#### Frontend Framework Selection
```typescript
interface ProjectRequirements {
  complexity: 'simple' | 'medium' | 'complex';
  teamSize: number;
  timeline: string;
  performance: 'standard' | 'high';
  seo: boolean;
}

function selectFrontendFramework(req: ProjectRequirements): string {
  // Decision tree logic
  if (req.seo && req.performance === 'high') {
    return 'Next.js'; // SSR/SSG with React
  }
  
  if (req.complexity === 'simple' && req.timeline === 'short') {
    return 'Vue.js'; // Gentle learning curve
  }
  
  if (req.teamSize > 10 && req.complexity === 'complex') {
    return 'Angular'; // Enterprise-scale structure
  }
  
  return 'React'; // Most versatile default
}
```

#### Database Selection
```typescript
interface DataRequirements {
  structure: 'relational' | 'document' | 'mixed';
  scale: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
  consistency: 'eventual' | 'strong';
  analytics: boolean;
}

function selectDatabase(req: DataRequirements): string {
  if (req.structure === 'relational' && req.consistency === 'strong') {
    return req.scale === 'large' ? 'PostgreSQL with partitioning' : 'PostgreSQL';
  }
  
  if (req.structure === 'document' && req.scale === 'large') {
    return 'MongoDB with sharding';
  }
  
  if (req.analytics && req.scale === 'large') {
    return 'PostgreSQL with ClickHouse for analytics';
  }
  
  return 'PostgreSQL'; // Reliable default for most cases
}
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Context Engineering vs Traditional Prompting

### Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Traditional Prompting | Context Engineering |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Consistency** | Highly variable results | Predictable, systematic outcomes |
| **Scalability** | Limited to individual prompts | Scales across projects and teams |
| **Quality** | Depends on prompt skill | Built-in quality standards |
| **Reproducibility** | Difficult to recreate | Fully reproducible processes |
| **Learning Curve** | Requires prompt expertise | Systematic methodology |
| **Team Collaboration** | Individual knowledge | Shared standards and practices |
| **Documentation** | Ad-hoc documentation | Comprehensive, structured docs |
| **Error Handling** | Manual debugging | Systematic error analysis |

### Real-World Impact Examples

#### Before Context Engineering
```markdown
‚ùå **Traditional Approach**
Developer: "Build me a React app for e-commerce"

Result: Basic React app with minimal features, no consistent patterns, limited scalability, unclear requirements, and difficult to maintain.
```

#### After Context Engineering
```markdown
‚úÖ **Context Engineering Approach**

System Context: Senior React Developer with e-commerce expertise
Domain Context: React 18 + Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma + PostgreSQL, Stripe integration
Task Context: Multi-vendor marketplace, 10k+ products, mobile-first, PCI compliance

Result: Production-ready e-commerce platform with systematic architecture, comprehensive testing, security compliance, and clear scalability path.
```
