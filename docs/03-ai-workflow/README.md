## üéØ Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

### Effective AI Collaboration
1. **Always establish complete context** before asking for code generation
2. **Use iterative refinement** rather than expecting perfect solutions immediately
3. **Validate all AI outputs** with human review and testing
4. **Document AI-assisted decisions** for future reference and learning
5. **Maintain coding standards** regardless of AI assistance
6. **Focus on understanding** rather than just copy-pasting solutions

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Insufficient context**: Providing vague or incomplete requirements
- **Over-reliance**: Accepting AI outputs without critical evaluation
- **Inconsistent quality**: Failing to maintain coding standards
- **Poor documentation**: Not documenting AI-assisted development decisions
- **Security oversights**: Not reviewing AI-generated code for security issues
