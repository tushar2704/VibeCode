# Feature development
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration
# Development work...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement payment gateway integration"
git push origin feature/payment-integration
# Create pull request to develop

# Release preparation
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0

git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"
# Merge to main and develop

# Hotfix for production
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix
