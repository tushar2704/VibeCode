interface CommunityHealth {
  hasCodeOfConduct: boolean;
  hasContributingGuide: boolean;
  responseTime: number; // Average response time to issues
  inclusivity: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
  mentorshipAvailable: boolean;
}

class ProjectFinder {
  static evaluateProject(project: OpenSourceProject): ProjectAssessment {
    return {
      project,
      contributionOpportunities: this.findOpportunities(project),
      difficultyLevel: this.assessDifficulty(project),
      learningPotential: this.assessLearningValue(project),

    const opportunities = [];
    
    if (project.issueCount > 20) {
      opportunities.push('Issue triage and bug fixes');
    }
    
    if (project.documentation.quality === 'NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT') {
      opportunities.push('Documentation improvements');
    }
    
    if (project.contributors < 10) {
      opportunities.push('Core feature development');
    }
    
    return opportunities;
  }

  // Good first projects for beginners

#### Contribution Workflow:
```typescript
class ContributionWorkflow {
  static async makeContribution(project: string, issueNumber: number): Promise<ContributionResult> {
    // Step 1: Fork and clone
    await this.forkRepository(project);
    const localRepo = await this.cloneRepository(project);
    
    // Step 2: Set up development environment
    await this.setupDevEnvironment(localRepo);
    
    // Step 3: Create feature branch
    const branchName = await this.createFeatureBranch(issueNumber);
