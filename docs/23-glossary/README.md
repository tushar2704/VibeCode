## üî§ Core Context Engineering Terminology

### Context Engineering Fundamentals

**Context Engineering**
: A systematic methodology for software development that structures decision-making and implementation through three distinct layers: System Context, Domain Context, and Task Context. This approach ensures comprehensive consideration of all relevant factors in software development decisions.

**System Context Layer**
: The foundational layer of Context Engineering that defines the role, behavioral guidelines, and quality standards for a development project. This layer establishes the overall framework and standards that guide all subsequent decisions.

**Domain Context Layer**
: The intermediate layer that specifies technology standards, architecture patterns, and domain-specific best practices. This layer provides the technical framework and constraints within which development occurs.

**Task Context Layer**
: The specific implementation layer that defines immediate requirements, constraints, and objectives for particular development tasks. This layer provides concrete guidance for individual implementation decisions.

**Vibe Coding**
: The original philosophical approach to programming that emphasizes intuitive development, rapid prototyping, and developer experience. This methodology evolved into the more structured Context Engineering approach while maintaining its focus on developer productivity and satisfaction.

**Product Requirements Prompts (PRP)**
: Structured templates used in Context Engineering to gather comprehensive requirements and context information. These prompts ensure all necessary information is collected before beginning development work.

**Requirements Gathering Systems**
: Formal processes and tools used within Context Engineering to systematically collect, organize, and validate project requirements. These systems ensure comprehensive understanding of project needs before implementation begins.

**Smart Defaults**
: Pre-configured settings, patterns, and practices integrated into Context Engineering templates that provide sensible starting points for common development scenarios. These defaults reduce decision fatigue while maintaining flexibility for customization.
