## üìù Style Guidelines

### Writing Standards

#### Tone and Voice
- **Clear and Concise**: Use simple, direct language
- **Professional but Friendly**: Maintain accessibility while being informative
- **Inclusive**: Use gender-neutral language and inclusive examples
- **Action-Oriented**: Focus on what readers can do and achieve

#### Content Structure
```markdown
# Section Title with Context Engineering Focus

> *"Brief, inspiring description of the section's value"*

## üéØ Overview
Clear explanation of what this section covers

## üöÄ What You'll Learn/Master
- Bullet points of key outcomes
- Practical skills and knowledge
- Context Engineering integration

## Content Sections with Proper Headers
### Subsection with Clear Purpose
Detailed explanation with examples

#### Code Examples with Context
```typescript
// Context Engineering Example
interface ExampleInterface {
  // System Context: Clear purpose and role
  systemContext: SystemRequirements;
  
  // Domain Context: Technical constraints
  domainContext: TechnicalSpecs;
  
  // Task Context: Specific implementation
  taskContext: ImplementationDetails;
}
```

#### Documentation Format
- Use consistent heading hierarchy (H1 > H2 > H3 > H4)
- Include practical code examples
- Add Context Engineering templates where relevant
- Provide clear navigation links

### Code Style Guide

#### General Principles
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns throughout
- **Context Engineering**: Include three-layer methodology
- **Comments**: Explain the why, not just the what

#### Example Template
```typescript
// Context Engineering Code Template

// System Context Layer
interface SystemContext {
  role: string;
  guidelines: string[];
  standards: string[];
}

// Domain Context Layer  
interface DomainContext {
  technologies: string[];
  patterns: string[];
  constraints: string[];
}

// Task Context Layer
interface TaskContext {
  requirements: string[];
  objectives: string[];
  successCriteria: string[];
}

// Implementation with Context Engineering
class ContextEngineeredComponent {
  constructor(
    private system: SystemContext,
    private domain: DomainContext,
    private task: TaskContext
  ) {
    // Implementation follows all three context layers
  }
}
```
